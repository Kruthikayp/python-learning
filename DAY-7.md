# Conditional Statements
Conditional statements in Python include if, else, and elif. These are used to check specific conditions and perform actions accordingly.

## 1. If Statement
The if statement executes a block of code if a condition is True.

Example:
```
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
```
## 2. Indentation in Python
Python uses indentation (spaces or tabs) to define code blocks instead of braces {}. Proper indentation is mandatory.

Example:
```
number = 5
if number > 0:
    print("Positive number")
    print("This is inside the if block.")
```
## 3. Else Statement
The else block executes if the if condition is False.

Example:
``
age = 16
if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")
    ```
## 4. Elif Statement
The elif statement checks multiple conditions after the if statement.

Example:
```
marks = 75
if marks >= 85:
    print("Grade: A")
elif marks >= 60:
    print("Grade: B")
else:
    print("Grade: C")
```
## 5. Using Logical Operators
Logical operators like and, or, and not combine multiple conditions.

Example:
```
age = 25
citizen = True
if age >= 18 and citizen:
    print("You can apply for a driving license.")
else:
    print("You cannot apply for a driving license.")
```
 Example:  KSRTC Bus Ticket
 
Letâ€™s check ticket eligibility for a KSRTC bus:

```
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
if age < 5:
    print("Ticket: Free for children under 5.")
elif age <= 60:
    print("Ticket: Regular fare applies.")
else:
    print("Ticket: Discount for senior citizens.")
```
## 6. Nested If-Else
A nested if-else is an if-else block inside another if-else.

Example:
```
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if number >= 0:
    if number == 0:
        print("The number is zero.")
    else:
        print("The number is positive.")
else:
    print("The number is negative.")
```
