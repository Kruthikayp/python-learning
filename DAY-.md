# Self-Learning Python Journey - Day 1

## Introduction
This repository documents my self-learning journey in Python programming. I aim to develop a strong foundation in Python and explore its various applications.

## What is Coding?
Coding is the process of creating instructions for computers using programming languages. It involves writing code to perform specific tasks or solve problems. Coding is essential for developing software, websites, applications, and more.

**Example**: Writing a simple greeting in Python.
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
## What is python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.
**Example**: A basic Python program that adds two numbers.
```# Adding two numbers
a = 5
b = 3
sum = a + b
print("The sum is:", sum)
```
## What is an Interpreted Language?
An interpreted language is one where the code is executed line by line at runtime. This means that the source code is translated into machine code on the fly, allowing for immediate feedback and easier debugging.

**Example**: Running a Python script directly in the interpreter.

```python
# This line will be executed immediately when written in the interpreter
print("This is an interpreted language example.")
```
## Why is Python Popular?
Python is popular for several reasons:

+ **Easy to Learn**: Its syntax is clean and easy to understand.
+ **Versatile**: Used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, etc.
+ **Large Community**: A vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.
+ **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more.

## What is a Dynamically Typed Language?
In a dynamically typed language, the type of a variable is determined at runtime, allowing you to change a variable's type during execution. This offers more flexibility but can lead to runtime errors if not handled properly.
``` # Dynamically typed variable
x = 5      # x is an integer
print(x)

x = "Hello"  # Now x is a string
print(x)
```
# TASK 
### 1.  Write a program that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen
### 2.  Write a program that asks for the user's name and greets them.
### 3.  Write a program that adds two numbers and prints the result.
